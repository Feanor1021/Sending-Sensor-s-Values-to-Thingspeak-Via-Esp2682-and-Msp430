The "Sending Sensor's Values to Thingspeak Via Esp2682 and Msp430" project is a demonstration of how to send data from a sensor to the ThingSpeak platform using an ESP2682 and MSP430 microcontroller.

## Requirements
To replicate this project, you will need:

- ESP8266 WiFi module
- MSP430 microcontroller
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
## How it works
The MSP430 reads data from the DHT11 sensor and sends it to the ESP8266 module via the UART interface. The ESP8266 is connected to a WiFi network and uses HTTP protocol to send the data to the ThingSpeak platform. The ThingSpeak platform stores the data and provides visualization tools for monitoring and analysis.
## Setup
1. Connect the DHT11 sensor to the MSP430 microcontroller.
2. Connect the MSP430 microcontroller to the ESP8266 module via UART.
3. Connect the ESP8266 module to a WiFi network.
4. Create a ThingSpeak account and create a new channel.
5. Edit the code in the main.c file to include your WiFi network credentials and ThingSpeak channel information.
6. Compile and upload the code to the MSP430 microcontroller.
## Code
The code for this project is written in C language and can be found in the main.c file. The code initializes the UART communication between the MSP430 and ESP8266 modules and reads data from the DHT11 sensor. The code then sends an HTTP request to the ThingSpeak API to upload the data to a specified channel.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to send data from a sensor to the ThingSpeak platform using an ESP8266 and MSP430 microcontroller. By following the steps outlined above, you can replicate this project and customize it to suit your needs.
